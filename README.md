# CodeIgniter 4

This project is a complete eCommerce website developed with CodeIgniter 4, featuring both an Admin dashboard and a customer-facing frontend. The Admin dashboard allows the administrator to add and manage product categories, perform operations on products (such as adding, updating, and deleting), and oversee user accounts. On the frontend, customers can browse product listings, add items to their cart or wishlist, and make purchases seamlessly. With CodeIgniter's efficient MVC structure, this application provides a responsive and user-friendly experience, allowing easy navigation for customers and smooth management for the admin. The system is designed to support all core eCommerce functionalities, offering a cohesive platform for both sellers and buyers.
